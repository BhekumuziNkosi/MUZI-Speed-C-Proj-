 ✅ MUZI-Speed – Typing Speed & Accuracy Test

A typing speed evaluation system originally developed as a **C++ Object-Oriented Programming project**, later expanded with a fully interactive **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** frontend.
MUZI-Speed measures user typing speed, accuracy, mistakes, and shows a leaderboard.
The project includes animations, neon effects, particle visuals, and sound effects.

---

🚀Project Overview

MUZI-Speed started as a **C++ OOP console-based typing evaluator**.
It used structures, vectors, sorting, and string comparison to calculate:

* Time taken
* Mistake count
* Accuracy
* Leaderboard ranking

It was later upgraded with a modern web interface for improved visuals, making the system more engaging while keeping the original C++ logic structure intact.

The final version combines **C++ system logic** and **modern web UI** into one powerful project.

✅ Features

* 🎯 Multiple practice texts
* ⏱️ Real-time timer
* ❌ Mistake detection
* 🏆 Leaderboard ranking
* 🎧 Typing + finish sound effects
* ✨ Animations and neon glow UI
* 🎨 Background image + particle effects
* 💻 Web-based interface (single HTML file)
* 🔥 Project still grounded in its C++ OOP origins

📁 Project Structure

The final version is contained in a **single HTML file**:

```
index.html
```

The C++ version of the system (original logic) is included in the documentation and project history.

---

 ▶️How to Run the Web Version

1. Download or clone the repo
2. Open **index.html** in any browser
3. Or run with VS Code Live Server for animations + sounds

---

🧪 How the System Works

✅ C++ Logic (Original Version)

The C++ version uses:

* `chrono` for precise timing
* `struct` for organizing practice texts
* `vector` for leaderboard entries
* Sorting algorithms
* Character-by-character mistake comparison

This maintains the OOP foundation for your academic requirements.

✅ Web Version (Enhanced UI)

* Updates UI dynamically using JavaScript
* Tracks time and mistakes
* Renders results
* Updates leaderboard
* Adds animations + sound effects

---

📊 Leaderboard

Displays top performers based on:

* Time
* Mistakes

Sorted automatically.
